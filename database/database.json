        "description": "Higashiyama-Higashi is a district in Kanazawa, Ishikawa Prefecture, known as the Higashiyama-Higashi district. It is an important traditional building preservation district and is known as the Higashi Chayagai (Higashi Tea House District). About two-thirds of the 140 buildings in the district are traditional buildings, and many teahouse-style townhouses built from the time the teahouse town was founded to the beginning of the Meiji era (1868-1912) remain in the district. The town has become one of Kanazawa's main tourist attractions. After Sakuma Morimasa conquered Kanazawa Gobo and built Kanazawa Castle in 1580, Toshiie Maeda entered the castle in 1583, and Kanazawa Castle Town flourished as a castle town. The Kaga clan encouraged its residents to learn how to chant, and many of them learned to sing, and the scope of the practice expanded greatly. Kanazawa became a town where people said, \"Songs are falling from the sky. This is the kind of atmosphere that remains in Kanazawa. In the Edo period, many teahouses lined the Sagawa and Asano river area on the outskirts of the castle town. In 1820, with the permission of the Kaga Clan, the Nishi teahouse town on the west side of the Sagawa River and the Higashi teahouse town on the east side of the Asano River were both opened and became very busy in 1820. At this time, the old irregular shape of the district was changed and a more formal district was formed. Across the Asano River to the northwest is the main Chayamachi, a part of the Chayamachi district. On November 14, 2001, it was selected as a national important traditional building preservation district under the category of \"Chaya-machi\" because it retains the original site layout of the town when it was founded and has many buildings in the chaya style, which is rare in Japan. The teahouse \"Shima\" in Nibancho was designated a national important cultural property on December 25, 2003, due to its high historical value, and is open to the public. The teahouse is described in the traditional Kanazawa dialect as the setting of the story (former \"Atago-machi\") in the novel \"Onna\" by Kanazawa-born author Yuki Inoue."

Its name comes from the fact that it was built by an Omi merchant. Locals call it Omicho. Omi-Cho Ichiban was opened on April 16, 2009, as a result of an urban redevelopment project. It is located on the southeast side of the Musashi intersection (Musashigatsuji), the starting point of National Route 157 and other roads, and is relatively close to downtown Korinbo. With about 170 shops and restaurants (some media reports put the number at around 180 or 200) on an area of about 2,8 hectares, it is known as the \"Kanazawa Citizen's Kitchen. Many shops are selling Kaga vegetables and marine products, which are specialties of Ishikawa Prefecture, and the area is known as a sightseeing spot not only for the residents of Kanazawa but also for its unique characteristics. On the other hand, with the opening of the Hokuriku Shinkansen in 2015, the number of tourists and the increase in foreign visitors to Japan has led to a decline in the number of local users and problems with tourism pollution. The market has also responded to the increase in tourists by implementing measures such as improving the communication environment and introducing PayPay payments."

It is also called \"Ninja Temple\" because of its complex architectural structure and the tricks it uses to fool the enemy. The name \"Ninja Temple\" is a registered trademark of the temple. In 1583, when Toshiie Maeda, the founder of the clan, entered Kanazawa Castle, he sought a political philosophy based on the central spirit of Nichiren Buddhism and the Lotus Sutra and built a prayer hall to protect the clan. In 1643, Toshitsune, the third lord of the clan, moved the prayer hall from the vicinity of Kanazawa Castle and built it. To avoid the Tokugawa shogunate's change of fortune, Toshitsune deceived and reassured the shogunate by accepting a bride from the Tokugawa family, taking his mother as a hostage, and playing the role of a foolish lord by growing his nose hair. At the same time, he built a cluster of temples (today's Teramachi Temple Cluster) where many warriors could stay, and built Myoritsuji Temple in the center of the cluster as a watchtower (the main circle in the castle). Myoritsu-ji Temple, which served as a fortress, was equipped with hidden staircases, hidden rooms, pitfalls, watchtowers, and underground passages leading to Kanazawa Castle to deceive the enemy. It is called \"Ninja Temple\" not because there were ninjas in the temple, but because of the complex architectural structure of the temple. It is said to have been built by Nichiren's grandson, Nichizo. Myoritsuji, which survived the war, is revered as a place of prayer by successive feudal lords. The temple has withstood the heavy snowfall of the Hokuriku region, and its unique architectural style has been preserved to this day. The temple has endured the heavy snowfall of the Hokuriku region and its unique architectural style has been passed down to the present day, making it a popular spot for visitors. Due to the complexity and age of the building, tours are by appointment only and accompanied by a guide. There is a conservation and protection fee of 1,000 yen for adults and 700 yen for children. Preschool children are not allowed to visit. The building may be damaged by luggage or other objects hitting the back of the building, so you are not allowed to bring in luggage on the back."
